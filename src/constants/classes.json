      "Spring Joy and Contemplation",
      "This class is open to all levels of players. The theme implies that we can use the harp for more than emotional expression, but as a vehicle for thought, while nature blossoms forth and we contemplate archetypes within the grand mystery of music! We will explore a variety of repertoire, from Carolan’s lively “Morgan Megan” to my own “Harp of Cil Rialaig” inspired in Ireland; pieces I have never taught before. The levels of playing for these pieces ranges from very simple to complex. Beginners, do not fret! There is material here for you; the rest of it may sink in, like different layers of a cake, including the little sprinkles of musical philosophy, but don’t let that overwhelm you. Also, know that the classes are all recorded for the benefit of future reference for every student.",
      "A Note to Beginners: There is much in this content that you will be able to learn; and other parts that will seem more advanced. In preparation for this class, I highly recommend that you review my beginner’s instructional harp video, ‘Magic of the Celtic Harp’. This hour and a half video covers all the basic fingering exercises for scales and arpeggio’s, plus instruction on how to play the first two Welsh tunes, #1 and #2. All those who register will be sent this link.",
