          Founded by Pam and Philip Boulding, Magical Strings has been sharing
          the joy of Celtic music and dance in the lives of people around the
          United States and abroad since 1978. They have recorded 21 albums
          encompassing traditional Celtic arrangements, original compositions
          and subtle world music influences, collaborating with incredible
          musicians such as Dan Fogelberg, Garrison Keillor, Alex di Grassi,
          Amadou Jobarteh, and Keola Beamer. When not on the road, Philip and
          Pam teach, build instruments, compose, and seem to have boundless
          energy for their creative life which is nurtured at their home, Magic
          Hill, on a beautiful farm by the Puget Sound.
