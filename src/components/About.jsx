      MAGICAL STRINGS centers around the Celtic harp and hammered dulcimer of
      Philip and Pam Boulding, at times augmented by violin, cello,
      pennywhistle, percussion and various instruments from around the world.
      Over the years their sound has drawn a large and loyal following
      captivated by a combination of traditional Celtic arrangements, original
      compositions and subtle world music influences. Their virtuosity and
      expressive style have been described as "warm, graceful and sonically
      gorgeous" by the Washington Post. Their music and stories have the effect
      of holding an audience and opening their hearts to a forgotten world
      well-veiled by the bustle and trappings of modern life. Pam & Philip
      BouldingMagical Strings has toured nationwide and abroad since 1978. They
      have recorded eighteen albums on four labels, including Flying
      Fish/Rounder Records, EarthBeat! Records, Allegro, and their own label,
      Magic Hill Music. Their ninth, released in July '96 on EarthBeat! Records
      titled Islands Calling features a collaboration of their family with
      fifteen guest artists (including cellist Eugene Friesen, guitarist Alex di
      Grassi, and Hawaiian slack-key virtuoso Keola Beamer) in a theme of island
      journeys reflecting their own world travels, from Ireland to Jamaica, and
      Madagascar to Hawaii. The album is comprised mostly of original works with
      some pieces based upon traditional ethnic melodies. Their 10th CD, Legend
      of Inishcahey, is a return to Celtic roots featuring the family quartet
      with a special guest appearance by cellist Eugene Friesen. Legend of
      Inishcahey has been hailed by the leading English music magazine, Folk
      Roots, as "...an exciting cross-pollination of Irish/World sounds
      delivered with freshness, style and panache... 'Legend of Inishcahey' is
      musical manna from heaven.” Pam Boulding performs on hammered dulcimer,
      and Philip Boulding plays Celtic harp (both nylon and wire strung),
      hammered dulcimer, tin whistle, button accordion, and valiha (a bamboo
      harp from Madagascar). Philip also designs and builds the harps and
      dulcimers, and has handcrafted more than 2,500 instruments since 1971. In
      addition to the unique sound of Philip's instruments, he also has
      developed some unusual techniques including innovative harmonics and a
      stunning vibrato effect on the steel-strung harp. He is known for his
      expressive power and dynamic pulsating rhythms. In addition to recording
      and touring, since 1977 Philip has run his School of Magical Strings in
      Seattle (and later Olalla) where he teaches harp and dulcimer. In 1988
      Magical Strings dramatically expanded their fan base when Dan Fogelberg
      requested that they join him on a summer tour that took the duo to 30
      major cities playing for crowds of up to 15,000. Fogelberg later had them
      record on his album River of Souls, and again, more recently, on his first
      Christmas album, released in the fall of '99. The family quartet,
      including Brittany on violin and Brenin on cello, toured Japan in
      February/March '97, and again in ‘99, performing ten sold-out concerts
      from Sapporo to Okinawa. Magical Strings has appeared frequently on radio
      and television including CNN, Japanese prime-time TV, and Garrison
      Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion." Their music was used to launch
      General Motor's TV advertising campaign for the Saturn car. Philip
      Boulding's parents were university professors, authors and peace
      activists. His father, Kenneth, was an economist; his mother, Elise, a
      sociologist; and both were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Philip's
      family often traveled and he began his lifelong love for islands during a
      childhood which included long intervals in Jamaica and Japan. Philip began
      his musical education at age six studying classical violin, but switched
      to guitar at age 12. Shortly after he began building guitars in high
      school, he was captivated by the sound of a hammered dulcimer. He
      immediately built a dulcimer and taught himself to play it. When he moved
      to the Northwest in 1974 he fell in love with the Celtic harp at a folk
      gathering. He submerged himself in Celtic music and traveled to Ireland
      and Scotland to research both ancient and current music and instruments.
      Philip has been a professional musician since 1974, receiving training at
      the Boston Conservatory and the University of Washington's
      Ethno-Musicology department, as well as private study with classical and
      jazz harpists, a master of the Rumanian cymbalom, an African kora player
      from Gambia, and valiha masters from Madagascar. Pam began playing piano
      at age four and studied classical music through high school. She turned
      her attention to art at Pitzer College in Southern California where she
      earned a B.A. in painting, sculpture and art history. Her paintings have
      been widely exhibited and have received several awards. She has taught art
      and music courses at various West Coast colleges and Waldorf schools. She
      founded a summer art school for children in Maine, where she spent her
      childhood summers sailing amongst islands with her family. Her father
      often inspired her with music he brought back from his travels to many
      foreign lands. Pam first heard a hammered dulcimer being played in 1977.
      "I knew instantly that I had to play this instrument," she recalls. Unable
      to find a hammered dulcimer after many months of searching, she decided to
      take a class at a school that also provided an instrument to learn on.
      Philip was the teacher. "When we met, it was like we had known each other
      all our lives." "I had this dream," remembers Philip, "to combine the harp
      and dulcimer into one sound. When I met Pam, I realized she had a musical
      spirit similar to mine and soon we were playing music together. It was
      like finding two complementary halves and creating an aural texture that
      is unique and complete in its musical expression. It allowed us to bring
      together the music we love -- Celtic, classical and folk music from around
      the world -- and to create something uniquely our own." Philip and Pam
      recorded their first album titled Glass Horse in 1980, released on their
      own label. This was followed by touring and seven top-selling albums on
      Flying Fish Records -- Springtide, Above The Tower, On The Burren, Philip
      Boulding - Harp, Crossing to Skellig, Good People All - A Celtic Yuletide
      Tradition (features the entire family and captures the spirit of their
      annual Christmas concerts held since 1978 in the Pacific Northwest), and
      Bell Off the Ledge, Islands Calling, Legend of Inishcahey and Beneath the
      Moon. Later they recorded Where Dragons Dance on Allegro’s Alula label,
      followed by three double-CD solo titles by Philip, the popular Celtic Mist
      (solo harp traditional music of Ireland, Scotland and Wales), Elegance of
      the Hammered Dulcimer, and Celtic Holiday, all released by Allegro. After
      Philip’s self-released CD of solo harp originals, Musings, they put out
      two more titles: Dances and Dream - Best of Magical Strings (2-CD set
      compilation from their first nine recordings), and Celtic Yuletide -
      Celebrating 31 Years Live!, comprised of live performances from their 2009
      Celtic Yuletide Concert season. The Bouldings' love for music is embraced
      by all five of their children ages 30 to 41, who currently return with
      their families from across the country to bring together their talents and
      merriment each December to Magical Strings' Celtic Yuletide concerts. When
      not on the road Philip and Pam teach, build instruments, run their School
      of Magical Strings, give school programs, compose, and seem to have
      boundless energy for their creative life which is nurtured at their home
      on a beautiful farm by the Puget Sound.
