      <h2>About Magical Strings</h2>
      <p>
        Founded by Pam and Philip Boulding, Magical Strings has been sharing the
        joy of Celtic music and dance in the lives of people around the United
        States and abroad since 1978. They have recorded eighteen albums
        encompassing traditional Celtic arrangements, original compositions and
        subtle world music influences, collaborating with incredible musicians
        such as Dan Fogelberg, Eugene Friesen, Alex di Grassi, and Keola Beamer.
        When not on the road, Philip and Pam teach, build instruments, run their
        School of Magical Strings, give school programs, compose, and seem to
        have boundless energy for their creative life which is nurtured at their
        home, Magic Hill, on a beautiful farm by the Puget Sound.
