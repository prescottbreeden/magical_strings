        <p className="about__blurb">
          Founded by Pam and Philip Boulding, Magical Strings has been sharing
          the joy of Celtic music and dance in the lives of people around the
          United States and abroad since 1978. They have recorded 21 albums
          encompassing traditional Celtic arrangements, original compositions
          and subtle world music influences, performing on their own crafted
          Celtic harps and hammered dulcimers, augmented with pennywhistles,
          button accordion, concertina and more. They have toured and
          collaborated with notable artists such as singer/songwriter Dan
          Fogelberg and slack-key guitarist Keola Beamer. When not on the road,
          Philip and Pam teach, build instruments, compose, and seem to have
          boundless energy for their creative life which is nurtured at their
          home, Magic Hill, on a beautiful farm by the Puget Sound.
