We are happy to present our 4th Annual Virtual Harp Camp from Magic Hill, which will consist of several zoom sessions over a three-day period, Friday-Sunday. Students who register will be able to attend all sessions. At least a basic working knowledge of the harp and technique is advised, but anyone can participate. There will be time for instruction, questions and practice.","The repertoire consists of pieces that will cover four of the common modes used in traditional music: Ionian, Dorian, Mixolydian, and Aolean, with the intent of de-mystifying the simplicity behind modes, which are all derived from the common diatonic scale. Each mode has a specific \u2018character\u2019 or mood it tends to convey through the music that emerges from it. For example, a minor mode (aolean) tends to sound somber or sad, whereas a major mode (ionian) tends to sound joyful, exuberant; granted these are very simplistic characterizations, which become more complex and subtle depending on each individual piece of music \u2013 and how it is played. A piece can also \u2018modulate\u2019 from one mode to another. Improvisation will be encouraged!","There will be one \u2018warm-up\u2019 zoom session in which students can get comfortable with the format, during which Philip will give an introduction and over-view of the weekend.

How does one go about it? Although there are several great certified programs for learning specific skills in this regard, it doesn\u2019t require training to know the benefits we give even in the simple act of playing a few arpeggios in a room with people; it warms the atmosphere, and they respond positively. In a world that is suffering from catastrophes of climate change, war, political divides, personal loss, and all manner of diseases, we are uniquely positioned to do something good with our harps, however small it may seem. Even science has acknowledged the importance of music in many aspects of human development and healing. The harp, as an archetypal instrument going back to ancient times in human history, is uniquely positioned to be an instrument for healing. In this class we\u2019re going to work with a few established pieces that grew out of improvisations. Simple tools will be given to help you improvise. This is important, as the work of healing sometimes calls on us to be spontaneously creative. It may sound daunting, but it doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. The levels of playing for these pieces ranges from very simple to complex. Beginners*, do not fret! There is material here for you. Also, know that the classes are all recorded for the benefit of future reference for every student.","A Note to Beginners: There is much in this content that you will be able to learn; and other parts that will seem more advanced. In preparation for this class, I highly recommend that you review my beginner\u2019s instructional harp video, \u2018Magic of the Celtic Harp\u2019. All those who register will be sent this link.","The class fee for the six-week term is $195.","Contact us to register!"]}}'

They have recorded 21 albums encompassing traditional Celtic arrangements, original compositions and subtle world music influences, performing on their own crafted Celtic harps and hammered dulcimers, augmented with pennywhistles, button accordion, concertina and more. They have toured and collaborated with notable artists such as singer/songwriter Dan Fogelberg and slack-key guitarist Keola Beamer. When not on the road, Philip and Pam teach, build instruments, compose, and seem to have boundless energy for their creative life which is nurtured at their home, Magic Hill, on a beautiful farm by the Puget Sound.',
