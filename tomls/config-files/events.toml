  "No, we aren’t talking about ice cream or fashion – it’s about how the harp is uniquely set up to take advantage of the archetypal modes and their profound expression in music through the centuries. We are happy to present our 4th Annual Virtual Harp Camp from Magic Hill, which will consist of several zoom sessions over a three-day period, Friday-Sunday. Students who register will be able to attend all sessions. At least a basic working knowledge of the harp and technique is advised, but anyone can participate. There will be time for instruction, questions and practice.",
  "The repertoire consists of pieces that will cover four of the common modes used in traditional music: Ionian, Dorian, Mixolydian, and Aolean, with the intent of de-mystifying the simplicity behind modes, which are all derived from the common diatonic scale. Each mode has a specific ‘character’ or mood it tends to convey through the music that emerges from it. For example, a minor mode (aolean) tends to sound somber or sad, whereas a major mode (ionian) tends to sound joyful, exuberant; granted these are very simplistic characterizations, which become more complex and subtle depending on each individual piece of music – and how it is played. A piece can also ‘modulate’ from one mode to another. Improvisation will be encouraged!",
  "There will be one ‘warm-up’ zoom session in which students can get comfortable with the format, during which Philip will give an introduction and over-view of the weekend. We will have an ‘in-person’ fire circle on Saturday night, where we’ll share some music, songs and stories from Magical Strings and guests, and any students who can attend!",
  "All music and materials will be emailed to registrants in advance. Site-reading skills are not essential, but would be helpful. Don’t worry if you can’t digest all the material given – it will be taught in ‘bite- size’ pieces, and everyone will receive something of value. The sessions will also be recorded and made available to students after the camp is done. The most important thing is to have fun!",
  "There are a limited number of spaces available – so the sooner you sign up, the better to secure your place in the Virtual Magic Hill Summer Harp Camp!"

New exercises will be given, with emphasis on arranging, accompaniment playing, and improvisation. ‘Airs in Pairs’ will explore how to extract a theme from a particular piece and morph it into another form.',

description = [
  "For many in the Northwest it wouldn’t be the holidays without the harps dulcimers and energetic Celtic sounds of acclaimed family ensemble Magical Strings. The tradition continues this year as Magical Strings announces its 42nd year of annual Celtic Yuletide Concerts taking place virtually throughout Puget Sound in December 2020! The Boulding Family’s musical celebration of the holiday season is a treasured tradition – one that will continue despite the limitations of the global pandemic. While we can’t come together in person with each other and the Boulding family this year please join us online to celebrate the season. As always Pam and Philip Boulding will be joined by their children grandchildren and select guests for an afternoon of enchanting Yuletide music. The Boulding’s perform on Celtic harps hammered dulcimers strings and percussion while grandchildren from the Tara Academy add Irish step dancing for a festive and memorable performance. This year we are all experiencing dramatic changes to cherished traditions and that certainly includes the Celtic Yuletide Concerts with 42 years of performing together as a family all over the Northwest.Thank you for supporting Magical Strings purchasing tickets and joining us for this unusual virtual celebration. We wish you a peaceful and heart-warming holiday and Christmas season. May this concert help to bring us closer together even though we all must stay safe and physically isolated from one another. Together we can continue to kindle the light of Yuletide!",

  "We are happy to present our ‘Second Annual’ Virtual Harp Camp from Magic Hill, which will consist of several zoom sessions over a three-day period, Friday-Sunday.  Students who register will be able to attend all sessions.  At least a basic working knowledge of the harp and technique is advised, but anyone can participate.  There will be time for instruction, questions and practice.  The repertoire will span the range from one of Philip’s innovative arrangements from the valiha tradition of Madagascar, Malagasy Greeting; and a beautiful Jamaican lullaby from Philip’s childhood, to traditional dance tunes with emphasis on arranging and accompaniment playing, and another beautiful ancient air from the Bunting Collection of Ireland, among other things.  There will be one ‘warm-up’ zoom session in which students can get comfortable with the format, during which Philip will give an introduction and over-view of the weekend.",
  "We are planning to hold a ‘Virtual Fire Circle’ on Saturday evening as per Harp Camp tradition- be prepared to play and/or sing along with some of the tunes; and maybe even take a ‘virtual walk’ around Magic Hill!  You’ll also hear some music, songs and stories from Magical Strings and guests.",
  "All music and materials will be emailed to registrants in advance.  Site-reading skills are not essential, but would be helpful.  Don’t worry if you can’t digest all the material given – it will be taught in ‘bite-size’ pieces, and everyone will receive something of value.  The most important thing is to have fun!",
  "There are a limited number of spaces available – so the sooner you sign up, the better to secure your place in the Virtual Magic Hill Summer Harp Camp!"
